# Mixed Reality Virtual Pet Companion

A mixed reality (MR) virtual pet companion experience for Meta Quest, featuring natural voice interaction and realistic AI-driven pet behaviors. This project integrates voice commands with immersive XR pet navigation, enabling users to control their virtual pet via conversational speech.

# Features
1. Voice-Controlled Pet Actions: Control your pet using natural voice commands such as sit, fetch, follow, wiggle, bark, and more.

2. Stateful AI Behaviors: The pet dynamically switches statesâ€”fetching thrown objects, following the player, and interacting within the physical room using NavMesh navigation.

3. Wake Word Activation: Uses Meta Voice SDK to listen for a wake word, then accepts further commands for a seamless conversational experience.

4. Mixed Reality Integration: Leverages Meta XR Utility Kit and Unity NavMesh for spatial awareness and realistic movement in your physical environment.

# Usage
1. Say the configured wake word(Hey Meta) to activate voice listening.

2. Issue voice commands like "Sit", "Fetch", "Follow me", or "Wiggle" to interact with your virtual pet.

3. The pet will navigate and perform actions within your physical space, responding to your commands naturally.
